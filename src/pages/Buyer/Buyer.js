          <h4>CALIFORNIA</h4>
          <p>If you are in California and you want a legal to drive, over 25 year old vehicle like a Nissan Skyline GT-R, you know it's not as simple as the rest of the country. Toprank Importers have navigated this obstacle , and can offer JDM, or other foreign cars, fully legal for California. California compliance testing, and smog testing (in use testing) are not the same. A direct import vehicle must pass compliance testing, then in addition pass smog testing to be legally registered in California. </p>

          <p>Prices for California modification and testing range from $7500 - $15000 depending on vehicle model and condition up to 1995. R32 and R33 Nissan Skyline GT-R are typically $11,000. The cars need to be near stock, and in perfect running order.  1996 and up can require OBD II, which adds significantly to the cost and complexity.

            California does not recommend the purchase or importation of these years of NON-USA vehicles, even if currently registered in another state. These vehicles require compliance with USEPA requirements in effect on the specific date of 11/15/1972. This provision when written, was considered by the California legislature as a gradual phase-out of very dirty "non-collectable" types of imports, as this specific requirement was understood to become increasingly difficult to meet. Today, this requirement, while not impossible to meet, would require testing expenses and modifications that far exceed most vehicles value and would make little sense from a collectors standpoint to attempt. The limited exemptions that could have applied to individuals moving to California were closed by

            (EXCLUDING any vehicle obtained by a California resident within two years of its date of production) require a "Certificate of Conformance" issued by the ARB after a successful laboratory test. This test is administered to the same standards required of new vehicle manufacturers, and for the model year of the vehicle . However, unlike new vehicle manufacturers, as an individual you are not required to meet the full range of additional testing and equipment standards such as On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) requirements, durability testing, low emission fleet averaging, or Zero Emissions Vehicle testing (LEV and ZEV requirements). So while these standards reference what a manufacturer must do, when required by the Direct Import requirements they apply to individuals importing a used motor vehicle.

            <span>1) What cars can I register in California?</span>
            <p>
              A - We are now able to bring cars into California compliance. More information - http://www.gtrusablog.com/2015/11/first-california-legal-nissan-skyline.html .California has its own EPA, called the ARB(Air Resources Board) often called the California Air Resources Board. The ARB sets California requirements. California is the only state to be able to set its own emissions standards, separate from the Federal EPA. So in the case of imported (direct import) vehicles over 21 years old, while they are Federally legal to import, the ARB controls the registration of vehicles though the California DMV. This makes this a difficult question to answer unless you go through all the questions below.

VIN 2017-15 Direct Import Vehicles Update closes the exemption on direct import vehicles in California. For more information contact the California DMV.
